# Exercise session - Atmospheric processes: from cloud to global scales

Public repository containing the python code for the exercises of the course "Atmospheric processes: from cloud to global scales" (ENV-407).

The repository is linked to noto (https://noto.epfl.ch), an online service that allows the students to run the code online.

To access the exercise, you can click on the following link:  https://noto.epfl.ch/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fltelab%2FAtmProc2023&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2FAtmProc2023%2FExercise_radar%2FExercise_radar.ipynb%3Fautodecode&branch=main&depth=1

If noto prompts you to select a kernel, pick "Python" from the list of available kernels.
We will guide you in changing the selection later during the exercise.

The link to install the Python libraries needed for the exercise has already been included in the exercise itself.
In case you need to access it directly, without passing from the exercise notebook, the following link will bring you to it:
